        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-red-400">Backstory</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Lugri Steele is a Half-Tiefling born into a humble family plagued by relentless oppression. His infernal bloodline, inherited from a long-forgotten ancestor, made him an outcast in his human community, further exacerbating his family’s hardships. When local thugs began terrorizing them, Lugri turned to a secretive cult that worshipped a dark and ancient goddess. The cult promised him power in exchange for servitude, allowing him to annihilate his enemies.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            However, Lugri quickly realized the goddess sought to dominate him entirely. Refusing to yield his will, Lugri forged a parasitic connection with her instead—siphoning divine energy to fuel his abilities while constantly resisting her influence. This battle of wills has shaped him into a cunning, pragmatic, and fiercely independent individual. Though often morally ambiguous, Lugri remains loyal to those he deems deserving of his trust and protection.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Now, he roams the world as a dark cleric, wielding the goddess’s power against her own designs. His tarnished holy symbol and battle-worn armor stand as a testament to his defiance and his willingness to face any foe, mortal or divine.

            <li>
                Lugri is a Half-Tiefling with a mostly human-like appearance, including pinkish skin, glowing yellow eyes, and faint infernal undertones. His horns are nearly imperceptible, blending into his dark, slightly wild hair.
            </li>
            <li>
                He wears dark leather robes adorned with sigils and runes, along with a tarnished holy symbol that he subtly altered to signify his rejection of full servitude.
            </li>
            <li>
                He wields a spiked mace and a shield etched with glowing runes, and his confident, battle-ready stance reflects his brutal pragmatism.

            <li>
                Lugri has a bard-like charisma with a morbid edge, often using dark humor and blunt honesty in his interactions.

            <li>
                He is quick to act, prioritizing immediate solutions over long-term plans, and can make morally gray decisions without hesitation.
