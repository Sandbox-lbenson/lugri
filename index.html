        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Lugri Steele</li>
            <li><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Tiefling (human-like appearance with subtle infernal traits such as glowing yellow eyes and pinkish skin)</li>
            <li><strong>Class:</strong> Cleric (War Domain)</li>

        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            Lugri Steele is a Half-Tiefling born into a humble family plagued by relentless oppression. His infernal bloodline, inherited from a long-forgotten ancestor, made him an outcast in his human community, further exacerbating his family’s hardships. When local thugs began terrorizing them, Lugri turned to a secretive cult that worshipped a dark and ancient goddess. The cult promised him power in exchange for servitude, allowing him to annihilate his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Lugri quickly realized the goddess sought to dominate him entirely. Refusing to yield his will, Lugri forged a parasitic connection with her instead—siphoning divine energy to fuel his abilities while constantly resisting her influence. This battle of wills has shaped him into a cunning, pragmatic, and fiercely independent individual. Though often morally ambiguous, Lugri remains loyal to those he deems deserving of his trust and protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, he roams the world as a dark cleric, wielding the goddess’s power against her own designs. His tarnished holy symbol and battle-worn armor stand as a testament to his defiance and his willingness to face any foe, mortal or divine.
